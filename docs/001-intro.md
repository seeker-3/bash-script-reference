# Reference Intro

Welcome! This is a reference guide for bash script. I think bash is a very fun and powerful tool with a lot of hidden gems, but it is a difficult language to learn with the current resources available due to them being either inaccessible or incomplete. My goal with the guide is to make bash more accessible and list all of the essential features as well as some personal tips and best practices.

<!-- shell vs shell script -->
<!-- magic vs pragmatic -->
