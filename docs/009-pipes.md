# Pipes

Pipes are an extremely powerful feature of the shell. They allow you to take the output of one command and use it as the input to another command. This allows you to chain commands together to perform complex operations.

## Pipe STDOUT to STDIN `|`

## Pipe STDOUT and STDERR to STDIN `|&`
